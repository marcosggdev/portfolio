                <p>Hi! My name is Marcos, and if you are here it's probably because you have seen my github profile or
                    CV.
                    I am a 25 years old and have been looking for a job as web developer for a while. This portfolio is
                    just one
                    more project in which i have invested some time to improve my visibility on the web and working
                    networks.

                <h2>Education</h2>
                <p class="brief-text">Marcos has completed a bachelor in science, a web development advanced specific
                    vocational training and
                    some years of the double degree in physics and mathematics</p>

                        <div class="icon" style="background-image: url('./img/bachelor.jpg')"></div>
                        <p>Marcos obtained a Bachellor of Science degree at I.E.S. Bernaldo de Quirós, Mieres. At that
                            time, approximately
                            2016, he had planned on studying for a graduate degree in the University of Oviedo. Since
                            science, and particularly
                            physics, was the matter he was most interested on, he decided to pursue the double degree in
                            Physics and Mathematics.
                        </p>
                        <p>After an admission exam, he got accepted and started studying and attending courses at the
                            Science Faculty, at Oviedo.
                            He studied there for 3 years. However, the 3rd year, the high stress that he felt made him
                            take a break.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="education">
                        <div class="icon" style="background-image: url('./img/web_development.jpg')"></div>
                        <p>Since Marcos had been studying his whole life, he wasn`t yet qualified for any technic job,
                            so he decided
                            to enroll in the Advanced Specific Vocational Training that the I.E.S. Bernaldo de Quirós
                            offered, with the objective of
                            finding a job in the next 2-3 years.
                        </p>

                        <div class="icon" style="background-image: url('./img/human_resources.jpg')"></div>
                        <p>Nowadays (2024) he has already got his title and is actively looking for a job, working on
                            his portfolio,
                            learning new technologies that enterprises find interesting...
                        </p>
                        <p>In the future, Marcos doesn't discard enrolling again in the double degree in physics and
                            mathematics until
                            its completion or starting a new one in Computational Science.

                    <div class="project-content">
                        <p>BloomJS was the final project that i did present to pass the Web Applications Development
                            Advanced
                            Specific Vocational Training that is taught at I.E.S. Bernaldo de Quirós, Mieres. BloomJS
                            was first
                            thought as a simple framework to generate graphic components that the user could copy and
                            paste on the
                            page he wanted. However, the most part of the project was written with just plain
                            Javascript, which made
                            the development tedious and slow, from the lack of syncronization between a real DOM and a
                            virtual one.
                            Furthermore, the project was developed during the practice period, while we were doing
                            Wordpress
                            tasks and other stuff at a startup, so i had not enough time to refine the project to the
                            point i
                            wanted, not even to a decent 60%</p>
                        <p>I estimate that it would take some months to take this project to the phase i initially
                            figured out,
                            so it was left behind because of the raising importance of other projects for my portfolio,
                            for example
                        </p>
                        <p>I don't discard working on it again in the future, at least when i end up with some completed
                            projects in
                            this portfolio.

                        <p>Newspaper is a project in which i tried to mimetize newspapers format and design in a web
                            application in which
                            every user can become an article writer and share its stuff with other readers. This page
                            was a
                            project to practice Laravel + VueJS, since i needed to acquire more knowledge on those
                            frameworks.
                        </p>
                        <p>Although this project is not yet completed, im still working on it and trying to learn more
                            Laravel and VueJS
                            features. I think this project will become a good example of what im capable of when i
                            complete it</p>

                        <p>As i said previously, i live in a rural environment. Living near nature is beautiful and
                            calm, but
                            it can be boring if you don't spend your time on some activity. At a young age i discovered
                            videogames
                            with a PS1, and have been playing in my free time ever since. Furthermore, with the years
                            passing by,
                            internet service providers deployed fast connection all over the place, so the people in the
                            town started
                            to be able to contact with their friends and family whenever they wanted.
                        </p>
                        <p>My videogame experiences always make me think about developing a simple but entertaining 2D
                            game and triggers
                            my creativity and expectations. I have already thought about its graphics, mechanics, modes,
                            online interactions and even its website, but this is, with
                            no doubt a very long term project.
                        </p>
                        <p>The project has already been started, and some things that i have worked on are: movement,
                            UI,
                            2D graphics, gravity, world generation, shading, lightning, weather...
                        </p>
                        <p>As i said, this project is not even near of being completed, but if you are interested you
